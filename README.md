# HR Case Study | IBM_MiniProject-II

## Problem Statement

* In this problem, we have been provided with information about various **internships posted** on Internshala. (This includes various attributes about the internships like location, duration, start_date of internship etc.)

* We have also been provided information about the **students who have applied** for the internship. (These include type_of_institute, current_year, academic performance of the student etc.)

* Any student is free to apply for any internship on the portal.
 
*While employers get high response to their posting, it is difficult to go through a high number of applications for the employers. They might need to go through high number of applications to shortlist the most relevant candidates. Hence an intelligent matching algorithm can help our users get better experience and enhance chances of meaningful profile matches.*

## Description of the files

* **Internship.csv** - includes the details of all the internships posted on Internshala. These details are filled by the company floating the Internship. Each row represents one internship.

* **Student.csv** - includes details of the students applying for the internship. These details have been filled by the student. Each row represents an experience of the student. In case the student has not filled any experience, there would be only one row containing details of student.

* **test.csv & train.csv** - include the application details (as applied by student) and the shortlist outcome
